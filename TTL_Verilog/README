This is a Verilog version of the CSCvon8 CPU. It is built with Verilog
models that try to faithfully reproduce the behaviour of the 7400 chips
that will be used to build the hardware version of the CPU. This includes
the propagation delays of the chips.

There are some issues, mainly the fact that I can't work out how to get
inout ports to work.

What this version does give me is a timing-accurate model of the system.
It has helped me to work out how to modify the wiring of the system to
ensure that the control values get set to deal with the delays of the ROMs
and other devices.

Many thanks to Tim Rudy who created many of the 7400 models used in this
version; you can find these models here:
